Terms:
 WSD - normal whitespace delimited file driver

 NESTED - appears to have multiple groups of info, somewhat inconsistently formatted

 REPORT - looks more like a report than a data file, tricky to parse and then group into "logical records"

 FLIPPED - like a table flipped 90 degrees, each row is a different variable with the values listed on the line

 HUGE - lots and lots of records in the file, unmanageable amount for a person to use directly

 TBD - something about the format suggests that more investigation is needed before deciding how to parse it

 MULTILINE - one logical record is made up of data from multiple records in the file

 FIXEDCOLS - fields appear in specific columns, possibly with embedded spaces, so the WSD logic relying on positions won't work

 VARIES - the fields included vary from system to system
